- 👋 Hi, I’m Abdulrahman Mohsen Badran, Computer Engineer Graduate From Nile University
- 💞️ I LOVE to bridge the Worlds of Software (Control Theory and Algorithms) and Hardware (Sensors, Power Electronics and other output transducers) through Embedded Systems!
- 💞️ I also adore 3D Modelling all sorts of mechanisms, specially mechanical reducers!
- 👀 I specialize in Embedded C for programming microcontrollers. Specially -> (8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PIC and STC MCUs).
- 👀 I Also like to use MicroPython on Any MCU that supports it! Allowing extremely FAST Development!
- 👀 I also specialize in python for automation, algorithm design, testing, general SCRIPTING and sometimes visualizations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced robotic actuator designs and control.
